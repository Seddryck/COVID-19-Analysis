# COVID-19-Analysis

This analysis is sourcing information from the John Hopkins University account on GitHub for all the data related to COVID-19: deaths, confirmed cases and recovered cases ([link](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series)). Information about population by country is sourced from Wikipedia ([link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_and_dependencies_by_population)).

The main goal of this analysis is to provide figures by country reported by millions of inhabitants. As such, we can more easily compare smaller countries to the bigger ones.

For some charts, a rolling average on 3 days is provided to smoothen the curves and minimize weekend-effects or delay in the transfer of informations. A special attention to figures using this rolling windows should be taken because the rolling window is creating a delay in the analysis.

This analysis is open-sourced on my GitHub account ([link](https://github.com/Seddryck/COVID-19-Analysis)) as a personal contribution and is not related to my employer. Feel free to contact me by creating issue in case of bugs in the DAX formulas or in the load process.

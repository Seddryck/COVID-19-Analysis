# COVID-19-Analysis

This analysis is sourcing information from the John Hopkins University account on GitHub for all the data related to COVID-19: deaths, confirmed cases and recovered cases ([link](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series)). Information about population by country is sourced from Wikipedia ([link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_and_dependencies_by_population)).

The main goal of this analysis is to provide figures by country reported by million of inhabitants. As such we can more easily compare smaller countries to the bigger ones.

For some charts, a rolling average on 3 days is provided to smoothen the curves and minimze weekend-effects or delay in the transfer of informations. A special attention to figures related to this rolling windows should be taken because the rolling window is creating a delay in the analysis.

This analysis is open-sourced on my GitHub account ([link](https://github.com/Seddryck/COVID-19-Analysis)). Feel free to contact me by creating issues in case of bugs in the formulae or the load of information.
